## WEEK 1 WORKSHOP

# AWS CORE SERVICES OVERVIEW

For week 1, lets start with getting the grasp on AWS foundational services and especially Amazon EC2!!

Get your hands dirty with AWS General Immersion Day workshop.

The hands-on labs are divided into basic and advanced modules.

• In basic modules, you will learn various features of AWS foundational services.

• In advanced modules, you will learn how to connect each service organically to create architecture like a 3-tier web application.

If you are starting your AWS journey, try and complete the labs in Basic modules- specially the core services - compute, networking, security, database and storage. We will dive deep into these core services in subsequent workshops.

If you are further along in your AWS learning journey, I will recommend you to do the cost management labs and the advanced module - web application.
